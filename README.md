# AI-Sokoban-Game-Solver
This project implements an AI-powered solving Techniques for the classic puzzle game Sokoban.

# About Sokoban Game :
Sokoban is a strategic puzzle game where a player pushes boxes onto designated target locations. The aim is to position all boxes correctly while minimizing the number of moves.

# Project Features :

## A Search:*
Utilizes the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to solve Sokoban puzzles efficiently.
## Heuristic Function: 
Employs a heuristic to estimate the distance of each box from its goal.
## User-Friendly Interface: 
Provides a visual representation of the game board, allowing users to:
Step through the solution manually.
Automatically solve the puzzle.
Observe the original board state alongside the animated solution.

# Project Goals
Demonstrate the application of AI search algorithms to solve challenging puzzles.
practical example of how A* search can be used to find optimal solutions.
Interactive user experience
